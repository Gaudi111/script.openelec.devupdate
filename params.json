{"name":"OpenELEC Dev Update","tagline":"Unofficial update add-on for OpenELEC","body":"![Icon](https://raw.github.com/LS80/script.openelec.devupdate/master/icon.png)\r\n\r\n**This add-on makes it easy to upgrade/downgrade OpenELEC development builds from a variety of sources, without leaving the XBMC interface. When you run the add-on manually you get a list of available builds from the specified source URL (configured in the add-on settings). There is also a service which runs in the background, so when a newer build becomes available, a notification will be shown to enable you to install the update.**\r\n\r\n**To perform an update the add-on will download the (possibly bzip compressed) tar file and extract the SYSTEM and KERNEL update images, and the associated md5 checksum files, into the /storage/.update folder. The update will then be installed on the next reboot. This is all documented on the [OpenELEC wiki](http://wiki.openelec.tv/index.php/Updating_OpenELEC#Manually_Updating_OpenELEC)**.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nPlease note that this is not an \"official\" OpenELEC add-on. If you hit any problems with it, don't ask for support from the OpenELEC team, please post on this [OpenELEC forum thread](http://openelec.tv/forum/128-addons/49855) or raise an [issue](https://github.com/LS80/script.openelec.devupdate/issues/new). If you have any comments/questions/suggestions please also post on the thread and I'll probably respond.\r\n\r\nI would like to say a big thank you to the OpenELEC team for creating and maintaining an awesome product. Thanks also go out to the awesome people who create and host their own OpenELEC builds.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nNow for some cautionary messages, in caps for extra impact!\r\n\r\n* **PLEASE BE AWARE THAT DEVELOPMENT BUILDS OFTEN HAVE MAJOR BUGS. YOU MAY EXPERIENCE FREQUENT CRASHES OR OTHER PROBLEMS WHEN USING THESE BUILDS.**\r\n\r\n* **DO NOT USE A DEVELOPMENT BUILDS UNLESS THERE IS A SPECIFIC NEED, OTHERWISE STICK TO THE OFFICIAL STABLE BUILDS.**\r\n\r\n* **IT IS BEST TO DO A FRESH INSTALL WHEN SWITCHING FROM A STABLE TO A DEVELOPMENT BUILD, AND VICE VERSA. OTHERWISE THERE COULD BE SOME CONFIGURATION ISSUES.**\r\n\r\n* **IT IS ADVISED TO BACKUP THE USERDATA FOLDER WHEN UPDATING. THIS STEP CAN NOW BE AUTOMATED, THANKS TO THE XBMC BACKUP ADD-ON.**\r\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nHere is the latest [changelog](https://raw.github.com/LS80/script.openelec.devupdate/master/changelog.txt).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n1.
